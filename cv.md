## About myself

Although my career began as a translator, my keen interest in web technologies led me \
to discovering my true passion for web development. Through studying at one of the most \
famous programming schools in my country, I acquired comprehensive
knowledge of HTML, \
CSS and JavaScript as well as frontend frameworks and libraries. <br> 

My previous experience as a translator has honed my attention to details, problem-solving skills, \
and ability to work effectively with a team. I am excited to leverage my skills even further and
contribute \
to any project where I may be useful.
