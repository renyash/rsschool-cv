## About myself

Although my career began as a translator, my keen interest in web technologies led me \

knowledge of HTML, \
CSS and JavaScript as well as frontend frameworks and libraries. <br> 

My previous experience as a translator has honed my attention to details, problem-solving skills, \

contribute \
to any project where I may be useful.
